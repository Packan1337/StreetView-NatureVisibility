# Thesis Project Progress

This section tracks the progress of the project. The following table shows the progress made each week:

| Week | Progress |
|----------|----------|
| 1  | Read papers on previous related work  |
| 2  | Worked on the code to download the street view images that will be used to model nature visibility in urban environments.<br>I created a Jupyter notebook that retrieves the road network of the selected city using OSMnx, selects points on the roads, retrieves features for each point, and downloads corresponding images. The notebook includes four main sections: <br><ol><li>Retrieving the road network and saving it as a GeoPackage file</li><li>Selecting points on the road edges</li><li>Downloading features for each point and matching them to each point</li><li>Downloading images for each point and saving them locally</li>|
| 3  | This week I will work on cropping the retrieved images to use them in a consistent manner, specially the panorama photographs. In addition, I will check [Zheng, X., & Amemiya, M. (2023)](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/12/3/108) paper to clean the unusable images.|


I will update this README file regularly to reflect my progress.
